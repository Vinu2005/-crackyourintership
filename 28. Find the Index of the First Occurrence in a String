Given two strings needle and haystack, return the index of the first occurrence of needle in haystack, or -1 if needle is not part of haystack.

 

Example 1:

Input: haystack = "sadbutsad", needle = "sad"
Output: 0
Explanation: "sad" occurs at index 0 and 6.
The first occurrence is at index 0, so we return 0.
Example 2:

Input: haystack = "leetcode", needle = "leeto"
Output: -1
Explanation: "leeto" did not occur in "leetcode", so we return -1.
 

Constraints:

1 <= haystack.length, needle.length <= 104
haystack and needle consist of only lowercase English characters.

class Solution:
    def strStr(self, haystack: str, needle: str) -> int:
        m = len(needle)
        n = len(haystack)

        # Check if both strings are equal
        if haystack == needle:
            return 0

        # If lengths are different, perform substring search
        for i in range(n - m + 1):
            for j in range(m):
                if haystack[i + j] != needle[j]:
                    break
            else:
                return i

        return -1
