A path in a binary tree is a sequence of nodes where each pair of adjacent nodes in the sequence has an edge connecting them. A node can only appear in the sequence at most once. Note that the path does not need to pass through the root.

The path sum of a path is the sum of the node's values in the path.

Given the root of a binary tree, return the maximum path sum of any non-empty path.

 

Example 1:


Input: root = [1,2,3]
Output: 6
Explanation: The optimal path is 2 -> 1 -> 3 with a path sum of 2 + 1 + 3 = 6.
Example 2:


Input: root = [-10,9,20,null,null,15,7]
Output: 42
Explanation: The optimal path is 15 -> 20 -> 7 with a path sum of 15 + 20 + 7 = 42.
 

Constraints:

The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [1, 3 * 104].
-1000 <= Node.val <= 1000

            # Get the maximum sum for the left and right subtrees
            left_gain = max(max_gain(node.left), 0)
            right_gain = max(max_gain(node.right), 0)

            # Calculate the maximum path sum passing through the current node
            price_newpath = node.val + left_gain + right_gain

            # Update the global maximum path sum if necessary
            self.max_sum = max(self.max_sum, price_newpath)

            # Return the maximum gain that can be obtained from the current node
            return node.val + max(left_gain, right_gain)

        max_gain(root)
        return self.max_sum
